Developed this model for USC's OpenShowCAIS++. The poster below showcases the details of the project. The project uses natural language processing to examine and comprehend movie narratives. Through a combination of cosine similarity and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, tokenization, and BoW, the model parses plot summaries to identify thematic and narrative threads, thereby providing recommendations that are more in line with individual viewer preferences.
