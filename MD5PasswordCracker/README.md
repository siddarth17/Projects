Project for my Cybersecurity class!

I developed a Python script that is designed for brute-forcing MD5 hashed passwords by generating random strings and comparing their hashes against a target list. The script uses a character set of numbers and letters, incrementally increasing the length of potential passwords based on predefined attempt thresholds to optimize the search process. It reads MD5 hashes from a file, attempts to crack each by generating random strings of increasing length, and computes their hashes until a match is found. For each cracked password, the script logs the plaintext password and the time taken to discover it. This method demonstrates the basic mechanics of a brute-force attack, though it highlights the inefficiencies of such approaches for longer passwords and underscores the vulnerabilities of the MD5 algorithm. The image below shows my results!

Analysis:
By seeing the time taken to crack the passwords above using brute-force techniques, we can see that the time taken increases exponentially as password length increases. This is because the number of possible password combinations increases exponentially when the size of the password increases. The difference between the time taken to crack the passwords between 1 and 2-character words or 2 and 3-character words is not that big. However, as the length becomes longer, the difference in time taken increases by a lot. For instance, cracking a 6-character password takes more than 10 times longer than cracking a 5-character password.
The possible characters in these passwords are lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers which means that there are 62 possible choices for each character of the password. This would mean that a 1-character password would have 62^1 or 62 possible combinations, a 2-character password can contain 62^2 or 3844 possible combinations, a 3-character password can contain 62^3 or 238328 possible combinations, a 4-character password can contain 62^4 or 14776336 possible combinations, a 5-character password can contain 62^5 or 916132832 possible combinations, a 6-character password can contain 62^6 or 56800235584 possible combinations, a 7-character password can contain 62^7 or 3,521,614,606,208 possible combinations, and an
 
8-character password can contain 62^8 or 218,340,105,584,896 possible combinations. With these differences, it can be seen that the number of possible combinations drastically increases for even a small change in password length. Additionally, the percentage increase in possible combinations also increases drastically as the password length is longer and longer. As most computers can only generate around 10,000 to 200,000 passwords a second, it will take a lot of time to crack longer passwords. Thus, password length strongly influences the time that takes to crack a password.
